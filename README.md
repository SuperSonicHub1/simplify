## Note
Since Simplify has left open-source, I felt it was important to archive the last version of this great extension before its MIT license was removed from the repository, specifically commit [7d5a8193a3de53ae506eeea87dbc20b868586a0a](https://github.com/leggett/simplify/tree/7d5a8193a3de53ae506eeea87dbc20b868586a0a).

A browser extension that brings the simplicity of Google Inbox to Gmail.

## How to use Simplify
Add the extension to your browser and refresh Gmail. Install the 
**[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj),
[Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplifygmail/), or [Edge addon](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mpohnjhkncdalhjdhpiphajhiahmcapn)**.


## Who made Simplify
Simplify was made by me, [Michael Leggett](https://leggett.org). I was Gmail's lead designer from 2008 to 2012 and co-founded Google Inbox. I've been writing Chrome extensions for years to simplify the apps I use but have only ever shared them with friends. With the unfortunate demise of Google Inbox, I wanted to bring the simplified email experience to Gmail.


## Is Simplify safe?
I'm glad you asked. You should always be super careful what extensions or apps you use, especially with your email. Simplify is mostly some CSS plus a little Javascript to apply the CSS. There are no trackers. No data is sent or shared. And no ads ever. Promise. All of the code can be inspected here on Github.


## Send feedback
Gmail has a lot of features and even more 3rd party plug-ins. I've done my best to support all these things but it still may not work for your setup and that's ok. I'll do my best to update the extension as Gmail's code changes and hope to simplify other apps in the future. The best way to send feedback is here on GitHub but you can also [email me](mailto:hi.simplify@gmail.com) or [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/leggett), and I'll do my best to respond.
